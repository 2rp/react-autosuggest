  2. Type `c`, and wait for suggestions to appear
  3. Press <kbd>Escape</kbd>

  **Observed behaviour:** Suggestions stay open

## Are you making a feature request?

1. Please describe your use case from user journey point of view, e.g.:

  > In my application, when user highlights suggestions (using the mouse or keyboard), I'd like to display additional information about the highlighted suggestion alongside with the Autosuggest.

2. If you have ideas how to extend the Autosuggest API to support your new feature, please share!

3. If you know any examples online that already implement such functionality, please provide a link.
