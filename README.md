## Under heavy development

**TODO:**

* Just open suggestions when Up/Down is pressed. Don't focus on first suggestion.
* BUG: When pressing Down to open suggestions, and then navigating to the last item
       and click Down, suggestions are closed.
* ENTER
* ESC
* Mouse interactions (add 'mouse-click' reason)
* onSelected hook
* Make sure onChange is called only when value changes
* Create minimal API to Autosuggest
* Add more examples
* Add support for scrollbar
* Write tests
* Write docs
